# Cooking Game

This is my first real game project, made with Godot and C#. The goal is to create a cooking roguelite, in which you will cook for increasly demanding clients while earning distinctions that will affect your gameplay and strategies.

The goal is to have all of the following features:

- A level builder, to build your own kitchen layout (done!)
- A Balatro-like round system (each level is a client who demands a certain level of quality measured as a rating to beat)
- "Boss" clients with very specific and / or challenging requests
- Earnable modifiers affecting the gameplay and strategy
- Different unlockable recipies
- Intuitive gameplay elements
- Playable with any input method (keyboard only, mouse + keyboard, controller) (done, for the moment!)

All while making everything myself. This means no assets from internet, the goal is to learn all the necessary skills, because that's what's fun! Only exception to this rule are fonts. Additionally, most tools used should be open-source.
